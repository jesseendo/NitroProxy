While N4SF provides some basic wrapping of the Nitro/Bunchball API via the NitroProxy class, I
found that there were some other functions that would make the setup and use of the N4SF package
easier.

After setting up Actions in the N4SF Admin Console, you can utilize the code in this project to 
dynamically iterate through a set of fields specified in a Custom Setting, and trigger the
appropriate Nitro Action if a field is intitially populated (changes from a blank value to a non-
blank one) or a checkbox flips from false to true.

Further work may expand the use case of this package to include other types of field changes.

1) Setup
	- The Bunchball_Settings__c Custom Setting object has 3 fields:
		Name: the API Name of the field you want to inspect
		Object_Name__c: the name of the Object on which the field above is located
		Nitro_Action_Name__c: the name of the Nitro Action you want triggered
		
2) Sample Trigger
	A sample trigger is included for reference
